So you wanna learn the modern web way? 🤔

Welcome 👋

To use modern web you need to know what the web itself (without any frameworks) offers.

You will be surprised how fare the web has involved. 🤗

## Misconceptions

You should know the fundaments in HTML, CSS and JavaScript before getting started.

If you feel unsure please follow [MDN's Getting started with the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web).

Before we continue we would like to clear up some misconceptions when it comes to the web.
Or how we like to call it "frequently misunderstood/forgotten web basics in the era of frameworks".

## Test Runner

Testing your code is very important to have the confidence to release often.
Green tests should mean that the change is good to go 👍
